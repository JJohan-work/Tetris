## Description  
A Tetris game made in javascript.   
_This project was based off the lesson giving online [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAUn1Lom6dw) but I started diverting off of it pretty quickly after implementing the rotate/left/right controls_


* * *

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap v5
* Git and Github
* JavaScript
* JQuery

* * *

## Setup instructions:  
* Go to [Github Pages](https://jjohan-work.github.io/#) to see see game

* * *
#### How To play:
* when on index.html press start/pause to begin game - pressing pause currently resets the game
* When adjusting width/height have the game paused as otherwise it causes glitches in the game

#### Controls:
* A / left = move falling tetromino left
* D / right = move falling tetromino right
* W / up = rotate tetromino 
* S / down = speed falling of tetromino


* * *

## To Do:
* Final Styling
* Preview next tetromino
* Game Over condition
* settings window to prevent mid-game setting change
* Code refactor to improve readability and reduce mid-game change errors

* * *

## Addition comments:
